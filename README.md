# auth_window
Login window with jdbc

In order to execute this project. You have to download the jdbc driver from 
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
or download it in my project
and add it to your build path

this is a simple auth system that can be modified and used on other project if you want to limit the access for users
(like paid version).

replace the url with your own host ip and info

this is tested on my host and worked perfectly
you just need to create a table in your database called 'users' and create two columns called 'username' and 'password'
